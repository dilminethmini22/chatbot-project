# Chatbot Project

## Project Description

This is a **React** and **Tailwind CSS** based frontend chatbot application. The app uses **Firebase** for authentication, currently supporting **Google sign-in** only. The chatbot functionality is powered by the **Gemini API**.  

Since the Firebase free plan has limited database access, the chat history is not saved in a real database. Instead, **dummy data** is used to demonstrate the history page and showcase the interface improvements.
