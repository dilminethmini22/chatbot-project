# Chatbot Project

## Project Description

This is a **React** and **Tailwind CSS** based frontend chatbot application. The app uses **Firebase** for authentication, currently supporting **Google sign-in** only. The chatbot functionality is powered by the **Gemini API**.

Since the Firebase free plan has limited database access, the chat history is not saved in a real database. Instead, **dummy data** is used to demonstrate the history page and showcase the interface improvements.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
